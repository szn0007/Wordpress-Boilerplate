Description: Throughout 2020 our team recycled over 8,000,000 lbs. of electronics using the highest industry standards. In 2021 our goal is to prevent 10,0000,000 lbs. of electronics from landfills and redirect them to be re-used as new products. Electronic waste has a damaging impact on our environment and thatâ€™s why we take responsibility to properly dispose of each piece of electronic equipment going through our facility.
